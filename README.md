The one file in this repo is how we gather all the data for our ML group. Using Vienna and it's documentation is not great, as it was orignally written for C and python was just sorta a sidethought. 
The documentation is insanely long, with no way to look up the function you want without using the search function (even then it's not great because you get duplicate results. (https://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/ViennaRNA/doc/html/api_python.html#global-variables) 
There is definitely room to optimize this code. Let me know if anything needs changing.
